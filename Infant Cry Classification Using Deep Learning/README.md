# Infant Cry Classification Using Deep Learning

This project classifies infant cries into 5 categories (e.g., hunger, pain, discomfort, burping, tired) using deep learning models trained on the **[Donate a Cry Corpus Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/donateacry-corpus)** from Kaggle.

## Models Implemented
- **ResNet-50** (transfer learning on spectrograms)  
- **YAMNet** (pretrained audio embeddings from TF-Hub)  
- **CNN Baseline** (custom lightweight CNN)
